Study on Message Queue TelemeTry (MQTT) port and implementation on the same in Raspberry Pi

It is a lightweight publish and subscribe system where you can publish and receive messages as a client.

MQTT is a simple messaging protocol, designed for constrained devices with low-bandwidth. So, it’s the perfect solution for Internet of Things applications. MQTT allows you to send commands to control outputs, read and publish data from sensor nodes and much more.

Therefore, it makes it really easy to establish a communication between multiple devices.

In MQTT there are a few basic concepts :

Publish/Subscribe
Messages
Topics
Broker

The first concept is the publish and subscribe system. In a publish and subscribe system, a device can publish a message on a topic, or it can be subscribed to a particular topic to receive messages

Messages are the information that you want to exchange between your devices. Whether it’s a command or data.

Topics are the way you register interest for incoming messages or how you specify where you want to publish the message.

Topics are represented with strings separated by a forward slash. Each forward slash indicates a topic level.

The broker is primarily responsible for receiving all messages, filtering the messages, decide who is interested in them and then publishing the message to all subscribed clients. broker used here - mosquitto
